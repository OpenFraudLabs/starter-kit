# African Fraud Pattern Library

## Mobile Money Fraud

### 1. SIM Swap Fraud
**Detection Strategy**:
```python
def detect_sim_swap(user, recent_logins):
    # Python detection code here
Banking Fraud
2. Ghost Loan Applications
Detection Strategy:

python
def detect_ghost_loans(applications):
    # Python detection code here
POS & Card Fraud
3. ATM Skimming Clusters
Prevention Checklist:

Install tamper-proof card readers

Implement camera surveillance

### File 3: `local-fraud-detector.py`
**Content: Self-contained fraud detection script  
**Purpose: Run fraud predictions without any API

Key Features:
```python
# Loads the dataset
# Trains a machine learning model
# Provides predict_fraud(amount) function
# Includes example usage
File 4: model-training.ipynb
Content: Step-by-step model development notebook
Purpose: Educational resource for ML training
Sections:

Load and explore data

Feature engineering

Model training

Evaluation

Prediction examples

File 5: README.md
Content: Getting started instructions
Purpose: User onboarding guide
Example:

### How They Work Together:
1. User downloads the entire repository (or individual files)
2. Runs `local-fraud-detector.py` for immediate results
3. References `fraud-pattern-library.md` for detection strategies
4. Explores `model-training.ipynb` to understand the ML workflow
5. Uses the dataset to build custom models

### Implementation Plan:
I'll guide you to create each file separately in GitHub:

1. First: Create `african-transaction-dataset.csv`  
   (Simple CSV data)

2. Second: Create `fraud-pattern-library.md`  
   (Pattern documentation with code snippets)

3. Third: Create `local-fraud-detector.py`  
   (Self-contained Python script)

4. Fourth: Create `model-training.ipynb`  
   (Educational notebook)

5. Finally: Update `README.md`  
   (Usage instructions)

Let's start with the first file. Would you like to:  
a) Create the dataset file now  
b) See the complete content for all files first  
c) Start with the fraud pattern library
